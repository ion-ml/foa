### Q 1.a

> Explain the inspiration, the main features and the expected function of the algorithm in words.

The novel metaheuristic optimisation algorithm described within this assignment has been inspired by Mitic, Vukovic, Petrovic and Miljkoiv (2015), whose paper concerned a Fruit Fly Optimisation algorithm.

FOA algorithms model the movement of a swarm of fruit flies towards food. They do so with regard to the interactions between individual fruit flies and the swarm. Individual fruit flies can not see the food. However, they are able to smell the food.

There are two main phases within FOA algorithms. In the first of them, the smell phase, the concentration of the smell of food associated with each fruit fly is calculated. The fruit flies closest to the location of the food should be associated with a greater smell concentrations. In the second phase, the vision phase, the swarm moves towards the fruit fly associated with the greatest smell concentration. After repeated iterations of the these phases the swarm should converge on the food.

The main additional feature proposed by Mitic, Vukovic, Petrovic and Miljkoiv (2015) is the incorporation of randomness within the smell phase. They suggested that this will improve the speed (measured by number of iterations) with which the swarm converges upon the food and, thereby, optimises the required function. This appears to be a convincing argument. However, it might be the case that exploration is being favoured over exploitation. That is, there may be values for which the algorithm proposed by Mitic, Vukovic, Petrovic and Miljkoiv (2015) is not faster than a standard FOA.

### Q 1.b

> If the paper contains several algorithms, then choose only one and justify your choice.

The chosen algorithm used a Chebyshev chaotic map. Chaotic maps are functions that exhibit chaotic behaviour. more specifically, a Chebyshev chaotic map takes the cosine of the inverse cosine of a value. This produces results between -1 and 1. The Chebyshev chaotic map was found to be the most successful map used by Mitic, Vukovic, Petrovic and Miljkoiv (2015), which was why it was chosen to be reproduced within this assignment.

In addition, the algorithm used by Mitic, Vukovic, Petrovic and Miljkoiv (2015) optimised standard functions. One of the most successful was Sum of Squares, which has been used within this assignment.

### Q 2.a

> Present and explain the main formulas that define the algorithm.

The main formulas used within the FOA algorithm by Mitic, Vukovic, Petrovic and Miljkoiv (2015) are as follows.

The algorithm starts by randomly allocating the food and the fruit flies to positions within the search space. The random allocation of the food was not defined, explicitly. However, the random allocation of the fruit fly positions was defined, and it calculates a pseudo random value based upon the lower and upper bounds of the search space.

```JavaScript
// PSEUDO CODE

fruitFly = lowerBound + (upperBound - lowerBound  * rand());
```

Within the smell phase, fruit flies are pseudo randomly re-positioned with regard to their previous best position and `alpha`, where `alpha` represents the output of the Chebyshev chaotic map. The re-positioning is defined using the following formula:

```JavaScript
// PSEUDO CODE

fruitFly (nextPosition) = fruitFly (currentPosition) + alpha(currentPosition - bestPosition);
```

Within the vision phase, smell concentration per fruit fly is defined as the inverse of the distance between the fruit fly and the food. Smell concentration increases as the distance between a given fruit fly and the food decreases. Conversely, smell concentration decreases as the distance between a given fruit fly and the food increases.â€¨

```JavaScript
// PSEUDO CODE

distance = SQAURE_ROOT((fruitFly)SQUARED + (food)SQUARED);
smellConcentration = 1 / distance;
```

Per iteration, the swarm moves toward the fruit fly with the maximum smell concentration. This process is defined by the following formula:

```JavaScript
// PSEUDO CODE

xBest = min (smellConcentration per fruit fly);
```

### Q 2.b

The parameters used by Mitic, Vukovic, Petrovic and Miljkoiv (2015) for the Chebyshev chaotic map / Sum Squares algorithm are as follows:

- Number of fruit flies = 30
- Number of trials = 50
- Iterations per trial = 700
- Search space lower bound = -10
- Search space upper bound = 10

### Q. 3

> Discuss the results given in the paper

---

### Q 4.a

> Explain your approach towards the reproduction of the algorithm of the paper:

The approach taken to reproduce the algorithm described by Mitic, Vukovic, Petrovic and Miljkoiv (2015) was motivated by portability. Consequently, the code associated with this assignment has been written in JavaScript. This means that it can be run within any web browser. Thus, potential compatibility problems that might have arisen had the algorithm been written in a specific server side language have been avoided.

In order to load the algorithm, open the following HTML page `dist/index.html` within a browser. The resulting page will display a form with fields representing the algorithm's parameters. The fields have default values for the Chebyshev chaotic map / Sum Squares combination. Modify the parameters as required. Then click the `run` button and the results should be printed at the bottom of the page.

The JavaScript code contains a separate module for each of the algorithm's key components.
- The `src/food.js` class defines the coordinates of the food.
- The `src/fruitFly.js` class defines the coordinates and all of the processes that can be applied to a fruit fly.
  - This class also retains the coordinates of the best position per fruit fly.
- The `src/fruitFlies.js` aggregates the fruit flies and handles communication between them and the swarm.
- The `src/swarm.js` class represents the swarm.
- `src/alpha.js` contains functions handling the Chebyshev chaotic map.
- Finally, `src/foa.js` contains functions representing the algorithm's phases, such as `smell` and `vision`.

In addition, `src/print.js` contains a function that prints the algorithm's results onto the loaded web page in `.csv` format, enabling the data to be easily copied into statistical / charting software.

Further information about how to load the algorithm (along with a description of the build and testing process for the modules described above) can be found within the `README.md` file at the root of the code-base.

### Q 4.b

> What simplifications or modifications had to be made?

One simplification that was made concerned the calculation of the fruit fly with the best position. This calculation is used within the algorithm's vision phase. The pseudo code provided by Mitic, Vukovic, Petrovic and Miljkoiv (2015) indicates that the best positioned fruit fly (at least for standard, rather than chaotic FOA) would have the lowest smell concentration (with regard to the function being optimised). Smell concentration is the inverse of the distance between a fruit fly and the food. A fruit fly with the minimum smell concentration would be the one furthest from the food. Consequently, the best position calculation was modified to find the fruit fly with the maximum smell concentration (with regard to the function being optimised). The method that performs this calculation is called `findBestPosition` and it can be found within the `src/fruitFlies.js` class between lines `108` and `124`.   

Another modification that was made concerned the movement of the swarm. Per iteration, the swarm moves towards the fruit fly with the best position. It was assumed that the difference between the swarm's `n` and `n+1` positions should be applied to all of the fruit flies. The method that performs this calculation is called `transpose` and it can be found within the `src/fruitFly.js` class between lines `233` and `241`.   

A further modification concerned the calculation used to determine the initial position of the food. This was not defined by Mitic, Vukovic, Petrovic and Miljkoiv (2015). However, it was assumed that the calculation would be identical to one used for the generation of the initial fruit fly positions. The method that performs this calculation is called `generateFoodCoordinates` and it can be found within the `src/food.js` class between lines `44` and `55`.

Lastly, the `alpha` function, which contains the Chebyshev chaotic map, only accepts values between `-1` and `1`. However, the values being passed to `alpha` are the difference between the fruit fly's current and best positions. In the majority of cases, such positional values were greater than the `-1` to '1' boundary. Consequently, the fruit fly's current and best positions have been normalised (by dividing both of them by the upper bound of the search space). This is performed by the `smell` method within `src/fruitFly.js` between lines `155` and `231`.

### Q 4.d

> What benchmark functions are you going to use and why?

### Q5.

> Choose one of the standard metaheuristic optimisation algorithms (such as SA,
ES, GA, PSO, or ACO) that is similar (but obviously not identical) to your algorithm.
Explain similarities and differences between your assigned algorithm and the standard algorithm that you have chosen.

Particle Swarm Optimisation is a metaheuristic optomisation algorithm that has similarities to the Fruit Fly Optimisation algorithm associated with this assignment. Both are p-series or population based algorithms, meaning that the result is an emergent property of a movement within and forms of communication between populations of particles or fruit flies. On the other hand, they differ in a number of important aspects.

### Q7.b

> What could have been improved if there was one more week (or one more year) to work on the problem?

There are a number of improvements that could have been made if there had been additional time to work on the problem. With regard to the interpretation of the results produced from the JavaScript algorithm, being able to directly visualise them (perhaps using a graphics library such as D3) would have been beneficial.â€¨
In addition, the code was written using the ES6 version of JavaScript, because that iteration of the language contains a number of useful features, such as array maps and class definitions not present in earlier versions. Unfortunately, not all browsers currently support ES6. Thus, a build step was introduced to transpire the ES6 code into ES5. In retrospect, it might have been simpler to have avoided this addition build step.

Another improvement that could be made if there was additional time would be to use Common JS module definitions, rather than ES6 module definitions.  Such definitions provide a means of separate JavaScript scripts importing and exporting information between one another. However, the base ES6 definitions do not run directly on command line JavaScript environment such as Node. Being able to do so would make test an using the algorithm easier, than otherwise.â€¨

With regard to the speed of running the JavaScript based algorithm within a browser, the code could be cross-compiled into Low Level JavaScript or Web Assembly, both of which claim to provide near C speeds of code interpretation. Doing so would be another means of making the algorithm easier than otherwise to use.
